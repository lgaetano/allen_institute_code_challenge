# Code Challenge: Retrieve Interesting Data and Do Something.
### by: Lia Gaetano

## The Question  
I was intrigued by the question -- What is the most prominently used programming language used in the public repositories of the Allen Institute? To answer this question, I utilized the GitHub API.  

Won't this be a fun twist on a code challenge to determine the language with which I, arguably, should code this challenge itself!  

## The Result  
Python is my main language of comfort and I have some experience with the Pandas library. With this in mind, I decided to investigate the difficulty of pulling, scrubbing and visualizing data using a language that might not prove as intuitive, JavaScript. What fun! The irony, of course, was that my investigations showed that most of the public repos on the Allen Institute GitHub page utilize Python or 'Jupyter Notebooks', which are a well-known playground for Python & Pandas code. 

## The Tech Stack  
[Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).
ReactJS.  
[React Google Charts](https://www.react-google-charts.com/).  
Regrettably not Python.

Thank you for the opportunity to learn!
